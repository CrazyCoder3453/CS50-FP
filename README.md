#### Video Demo: 
#### Description:
This is a platform built using React.js, styled-components, and MUI Icons where people can add cs50 items to their cart, see the price, and buy the items. (Nothing is actually shipped and no money is actually recieved). This was a very fun learning experience because React uses component. Each componnet in the components folder is named for what it does. It has the Ad, Header, Popular, Sidebar, and Section.js files which are used all throughout the program and were very reusable. It took a lot of time and research to figure this project out. Most of it was on routing with React Router v6 as it was rather confusing at the start. In the end, I am very proud of the product I was able to achieve. Thank you Harvard, David Malan, and all the CS50 staff for making this course accessible to everyone. This was CS50x!
